 With the Exclusive Lock, a data item can be read as well as written







Initially, all users will be informed that the item is available, but we will need to fail two bookings... 
To reduce overhead, its storage mechanisms and computational methods should be easy. 
Distributed 2PL has much higher communication costs than main copy 2PL. 
The Two Phase Locking protocol aids in the elimination of the DBMS concurrency problem.
 Make a reservation for a specific seat.







Initially, all users will be informed that the item is available, but we will have to cancel two bookings...
 To cut down on overhead, it should have simple storage and computation mechanisms. 
Distributed 2PL has significantly higher communication costs than main copy 2PL.
 In a database management system, the Two Phase Locking protocol aids in the elimination of concurrency issues.
